Continuing with the bikeshare data from yesterday.

1. Plot the daily temperature over the course of the year.
(This should probably be a line chart.)  Create a bar chart that shows
the average temperature and humidity by month.

2. Use a scatterplot to show how the daily rental volume varies with temperature.
Use a different series (with different colors) for each season.

3. How do the rental volumes vary with geography?  Compute the average daily
rentals for each station and use this as the radius for a scatterplot of
each station's latitude and longitude.

4. Building on the "swap on click" example, create a webpage that visualizes
bubbleSort.  (Look up the algorithm on Wikipedia, in case you don't know it.)
Then do something like the following:

* create a bar graph with *n* random values.
* run bubbleSort, using `graphSwap` to perform the swaps.
